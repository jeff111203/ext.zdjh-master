## Summary
Based on the design of Arduino Leonardo controller, the current temperature and humidity and soil humidity can be monitored in real time by using soil humidity sensor and air temperature and humidity sensor. The humidity threshold can be set manually. When the humidity is lower than a certain value, the water pump will be started automatically. It is suitable for different kinds of plants. On board an XBee interface, which can plug in WiFi, Bluetooth, ZigBee and other wireless devices, connect to the local gateway, so as to realize the remote control of the Internet of things. Even if you are not at home, you can automatically take care of your flowers and plants to avoid your worries.
